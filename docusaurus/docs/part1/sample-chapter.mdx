# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

<PersonalizeButton />
<TranslateButton />

Welcome to the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This field combines artificial intelligence with physical systems to create machines that can interact with the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

<Highlighter>
Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate in the physical world, as opposed to purely digital environments. These systems must handle real-world complexities like uncertainty, noise, and dynamic environments.

## Key Components of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots require several key components to function effectively:

1. **Sensors**: For perceiving the environment
2. **Actuators**: For physical movement and interaction
3. **Control Systems**: For coordinating actions
4. **AI Algorithms**: For decision making and learning

<Highlighter>
The integration of these components allows humanoid robots to perform complex tasks that require both physical dexterity and intelligent decision-making capabilities.
