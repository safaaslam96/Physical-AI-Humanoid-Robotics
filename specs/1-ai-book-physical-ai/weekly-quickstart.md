# Weekly Plan Quickstart Guide: AI-Powered Book Development

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for managing and tracking the 13-week development plan for the AI-powered book project.

## Project Management Setup

### Prerequisites
- Project management tool (Jira, Trello, or similar)
- Access to development repositories
- Communication channels (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Documentation tools (Confluence, Notion, etc.)

### Initial Setup
1. Import the 13-week plan into your project management tool
2. Create team accounts and assign roles
3. Set up automated reporting and notification systems
4. Configure access permissions for different stakeholders

## Weekly Workflow

### Week Start (Monday)
- Review the week's tasks and objectives from the weekly plan
- Assign tasks to team members based on expertise
- Set up daily standups for progress tracking
- Confirm all dependencies from previous weeks are resolved

### Mid-Week Checkpoint (Wednesday)
- Assess progress against planned milestones
- Identify any blockers or delays
- Adjust task priorities if needed
- Update progress tracking systems

### Week End (Friday)
- Complete all planned tasks or move incomplete ones to next week
- Document any issues or lessons learned
- Prepare progress report for stakeholders
- Plan for the following week's dependencies

## Tracking Key Metrics

### Progress Indicators
- Task completion percentage per week
- Milestone achievement rate
- Feature development velocity
- Quality metrics (bug count, test coverage)

### Risk Indicators
- Number of blocked tasks
- Schedule variance from planned dates
- Resource allocation efficiency
- Team capacity utilization

## Communication Protocols

### Daily Standups
- Time: 15 minutes, daily at 9:30 AM
- Format: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any blockers?
- Tool: Video call or chat-based standup

### Weekly Reports
- Due: Every Friday by 5:00 PM
- Format: Completed tasks, in-progress tasks, blockers, next week's focus
- Distribution: All stakeholders and team members

### Escalation Process
- Level 1: Team lead for task-level issues
- Level 2: Project manager for milestone delays
- Level 3: Stakeholders for critical path issues

## Quality Assurance Process

### Code Reviews
- Every pull request must have at least one approval
- Automated testing must pass before review
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD

### Testing Schedule
- Unit tests: Continuous during development
- Integration tests: End of each week
- End-to-end tests: After each milestone
- Performance tests: Weeks 12-13

## Risk Management

### Common Risks and Mitigation
- **Technical complexity**: Early implementation of complex features (Weeks 4-5)
- **Resource constraints**: Cross-training team members on critical components
- **Dependency delays**: Built-in buffer time in Weeks 12-13
- **Scope creep**: Strict change management process after planning phase

### Monitoring Triggers
- More than 30% of tasks blocked in a week
- Two consecutive weeks of missed milestones
- Critical path delay of more than 2 days
- Quality metrics falling below acceptable thresholds

## Stakeholder Updates

### Reporting Schedule
- Weekly progress reports: Every Friday
- Milestone completion: Immediate notification
- Major changes: Within 24 hours of decision
- Final delivery: Comprehensive project summary

### Success Criteria
- All base features (book creation, RAG chatbot) completed by Week 12
- All bonus features completed by Week 13
- Performance targets met (response times, concurrent users)
- Quality standards achieved (accessibility, security)
- On-time delivery within the 13-week timeline
