## Course Overview
The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Main Learning Modules
- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Middleware for robot control
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Physics simulation and environment building
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Advanced perception and training
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Convergence of LLMs and Robotics
